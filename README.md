Wine Quality Prediction
Project Overview
This project is a Wine Quality Prediction tool that helps users predict the quality of wine based on various input parameters such as acidity, alcohol content, sugar levels, etc. The prediction is made using a regression model trained on a pre-existing dataset of wine quality scores, and the frontend interface is developed using Tkinter for easy user interaction.

Features
Regression-based Model: The project uses a machine learning regression model to predict wine quality based on several features.
Tkinter Frontend: A user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter for inputting wine parameters and viewing predictions.
CSV Dataset: The project uses a CSV file containing historical wine quality data to train and evaluate the model.
Parameters Considered
The model takes the following wine characteristics as input:

Fixed Acidity: The level of fixed acids in the wine, which contributes to its tartness.
Volatile Acidity: The amount of volatile acids that can affect the wine's aroma and flavor.
Citric Acid: A key acid that adds freshness to the wine.
Residual Sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation.
Chlorides: The salt level in the wine, which can impact the taste.
Free Sulfur Dioxide: This preserves the wine and prevents oxidation.
Total Sulfur Dioxide: A measure of the total SO₂ levels, which also affects preservation.
Density: The wine's density, indicating sugar and alcohol content.
pH Level: The pH level indicates the wine's acidity.
Sulphates: These contribute to the wine's body and flavor.
Alcohol Content: The percentage of alcohol by volume.
Wine Age: The age of the wine can also impact its flavor and quality.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.x
Tkinter (Python’s standard GUI library)
Pandas
Scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/unusualmold2003/winequality.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd winequality
Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Running the Project
Ensure that the wine_data.csv file is in the root directory of the project.
Run the following command to launch the Tkinter interface:
bash
Copy code
python 6.py
Input the required wine characteristics in the provided fields and click "Predict" to see the wine quality score.
Model Details
The project uses a linear regression model to predict wine quality. The model was trained using a dataset of over 1,500 wine samples, with features like acidity, alcohol content, and others serving as predictors. The target variable is the wine's quality, rated on a scale from 0 to 10.

Model Training
Algorithm: Linear Regression
Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² score
You can retrain the model with different algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Gradient Boosting to further improve accuracy.
